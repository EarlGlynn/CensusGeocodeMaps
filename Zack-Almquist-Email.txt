Hi Earl,

Yeah that just needs to be updated, it should work fine no problem.

Error in install.tract("windows") : Not Available Yet

I found this in the source code for install.tract:

if (x == "windows") {
        rVer <- as.numeric(R.Version()$minor)
        if (rVer >= 11) {
            install.packages("UScensus2010tract", repos = "http://lakshmi.calit2.uci.edu/census2000/R/",
                type = "source")
            return()
        }
        else {
            stop("Not Available Yet")
        }

Was the R.Version()$minor check above for $R.Version()$major == 2?

Should the install.packages statement above be OK for  "R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10)"?

Thanks for clarifying this.

And thanks for creating these US Census packages for R.
